# My-first-project-clicker-game-
Description:
This is my first clicker so you may tell me my errors and some ideas. This clicker wasn't created for fun gaming. It is just the game where you clicking the button and you getting score. Also in this game clicks are counting. There's a shop where you can buy double score multiplier (costs 4000$ game money). Good luck!
Readme:
